# 🛡️ AI Cyber Threat Detection

This project is a machine learning-based system for detecting cyber threats from network traffic. It uses supervised learning techniques on real-world intrusion datasets to classify traffic into normal or malicious categories (like DoS, Port Scan, Infiltration, etc.).

🚀 Built as part of a cybersecurity-focused initiative with a Flask-based interface and multi-model backend.

## 🔍 Overview

Cybersecurity threats are becoming increasingly complex and frequent. This project aims to develop an intelligent, AI-powered solution to automatically detect malicious traffic patterns using well-known datasets like CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD.

The backend model analyzes input features (e.g., flow duration, protocol, packet size) and predicts whether the traffic is benign or malicious, and which type of attack it may represent.

## ✅ Features

- Upload preprocessed network traffic files (CSV format)
- Real-time or batch-based prediction of cyber threats
- Multi-class attack classification
- Interactive web UI built with Flask
- Visualizations of threat types and model performance
- Easily extendable model pipeline
